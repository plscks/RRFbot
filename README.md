# The Ridleybank Resistence Front - Nexus Clash Discord Bot

This is the home of the [RRF-NC discord](https://discord.gg/CPqn4kq) bot: RRFbot. There will be a couple of individual scripts here, both
will be written in python and both will utilize [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). The first will be my original bot
script that has since depreciated, it has been a while at this point since I started messing with it and initially to get the functionality
that I was after I had to use the *rewrite* branch. I'm am fairly certain that this branch has since been merged to the master branch anyways.
That and the fact that the bot exclusively uses python 3.6, makes it fairly legacy at this point. The second script will be my rewrite of the
bot, hopefully things go smoothly. It will ideally be using the latest [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) along with python 3.7+.
I have also decided that I will tool around with node.js and [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/). It will most likely be rather fun and it
should be a fun learning experience.

Here is a run down of the existing features (which ideally will not change):

* **.sm** - Sorcerer's Might timer
* **.craft** - Give crafting info
* **.mats** - Gives info on components such as find rates and rarity
* **.alch** - Gives information of alchemy recipe ratios
* **.greet** - Greeting message
* **.cat** - Sometimes scary gif
* **.info** - Gives info on the RRFbot
* **.help** - Displays the help menu

### Ideal Features to Implement
* SM timers per individual that are resetable
* Possibly character planner/hypermap/profile lookup interaction

Please feel free to make feature requests
